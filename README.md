## How to install
The banking graph program requires:
- <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3107/">Python 3.10.7</a>
- requests
- pickle
- time
- os
- matplotlib
- A Hypixel API Key
- Your Minecraft Player UUID

<!-- First a list of all the requirements to run the program 
If necessary use #### Headlines for subcategories
Detailed description of how to install the specific requirements and everything the user has to consider for the program to run properly
-->


## How to use

<!-- Everything that has to be done in order for the program to work properly, changes the user can make to customize the result and things the user has to pay attention to, to ensure that the program runs without errors -->

## How it works

<!-- Detailed description of how the program works and maybe the thought process that went into creating it -->

## Tests and results 
<!-- OPTIONAL -->

<!-- Some tests run on the program, to ensure and show that everything works without any problems
e.g. Accuracy 
-->

## Problems 

Sometimes the program does not recieve the required banking data from the Hypixel API this prblem is 'solved' in the program with try-except. When you see the following being printed in the terminal:

```
Could not connect to Hypixel Banking API. Please try again in a few moments.
```

you have to restart the program.

In a future version I plan to automatically restart the problem but for the moment I ran out of time.
