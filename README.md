## How to install
The banking graph program requires:
- <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3107/">Python 3.10.7</a>
- <a href="https://pypi.org/project/requests/">requests</a>
- <a href="https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/">matplotlib</a>
- pickle
- time
- os
- A Hypixel API Key
- Your Minecraft Player UUID

#### Installing the libraries
The libraries **pickle**, **time** and **os** are pre-installed with Python.

The remaining libraries can be installed with pip using this command:

```cmd
pip install requests matplotlib
```

#### How to get a Hypixel API key

To get an API key you have to join <a href="https://hypixel.net">mc.hypixel.net</a> and type the following command in the chat:

```
/api
```

This command will generate you an API key in the chat which you need to reach the Hypixel API, so save it to make sure that you do not lose it and NEVER give it to somebody else.


#### How to get your Minecraft Player UUID

To find your Minecraft Player UUID go to a page like <a href="https://minecraftuuid.com">minecraftuuid.com</a> and put in your username and it will show you your Player UUID which you should save for later.

You have to use the same username on which you have your SkyBlock profiles.

#### Installing Banking graph

To install this program simply download this repository as a .zip file and unpack it in a folder.

## How to use

#### Setup in Hypixel

First of all, you need to enable the Banking API in Hypixel.

To do that you have to join the profile you want this program to work on and open you SkyBlock Menu with the Nether Star in you hotbar. In there you have to open the Settings (Picture 1).

From the settings page you have to navigae to your island settings (Picture 2).

Then you can activate the Banking API by clicking on the icon below the gold ingot (Picture 3). Make sure that the icon is green because otherwise the Hypixel API will not give the required informations needed for the program to wirk.
